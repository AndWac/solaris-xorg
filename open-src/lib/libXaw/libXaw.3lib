.TH libXaw 3lib "18 June 2012" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
libXaw \- X Athena Widgets
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Xaw
is a widget set based on the X Toolkit Intrinsics (Xt) Library.  This
release of __distroname__ includes 3 versions of the Xaw library.  Since
the libXaw object model exposes structure sizes and layouts as part of the
ABI, binary compatibility is not always maintained between major releases
from the upstream X Window System projects.
.PP
.B libXaw.so.7
is the current release of libXaw, from the X11R7 release series.  Headers are 
provided for building applications against this version, and the 
.B libXaw
compilation link for -lXaw points to this version.
.PP
.BR libXaw.so.5 " and " libXaw.so.4
are provided for binary compatibility with applications built on older Solaris
releases.
.B libXaw.so.5
is compatible with the X11R5 and X11R6 release series, and was the version of
libXaw that applications built on Solaris 2.3 through Solaris 10 were linked
with.
.B libXaw.so.4
is based on the X11R4 sources, and was linked to applications built on
Solaris 2.2 and prior releases of Solaris.
.PP
Future releases of Solaris might not include the libXaw.so.4 or libXaw.so.5
libraries.   Applications using the Athena Widgets which need to run on
future releases of Solaris should be rebuilt against the current Xaw headers
and 
.B libXaw.so.7
library.

.SH NOTES
libXaw is provided for the benefit of existing software written to use
this library.  For writing new software, it is recommended that a
modern toolkit, such as
.BR libgtk-x11-2.0 "(3), " 
is used instead, to provide required features such as full
internationalization and accessibility support, antialiased text,
modern rendering engines, and better integration with the desktop.
